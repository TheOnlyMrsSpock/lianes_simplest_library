# Liana's Simplest Library ðŸ“š

## Summary
Liana's Simplest Library is a lightweight library management system built using Python, MySQL, and Streamlit. It allows users to manage books, borrowers, and loans via a simple web-based interface. 
The project was developed as part of a team assignment during the **Data Science & AI Bootcamp at WBS Coding School** (Spring 2025). 
The app uses SQL stored procedures for database interactions and provides real-time updates on book availability and lending status.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Languages:** Python, SQL (MySQL)
- **Libraries/Tools:** 
  - Streamlit (Frontend interface)
  - SQLAlchemy (Database connection)
  - Pandas (Data processing)
  - Plotly (Visualizations)
  - HTML & CSS (Table styling inside Streamlit)

## Key Learnings
- Developed a deeper understanding of how to integrate Python applications with relational databases via stored procedures and SQLAlchemy.
- Gained hands-on experience with building interactive web apps using Streamlit.
- Practiced collaborative version control and workflow coordination in a team of three.
- Improved the ability to clearly document, communicate, and debug issues in a live coding setting.
- Recognized the importance of designing intuitive user flows and maintaining clean code structure.

## Challenges Overcame
- Correctly mapping database outputs to the Streamlit frontend, especially where join queries and status-based filtering were involved.
- Handling persistent form states and automatic field clearing within Streamlit using session management.
- Debugging incorrect field mappings between SQL procedures and app input logic.
- Working with local database setups across different machines and ensuring proper connections through SQLAlchemy.

## Additional Reflections
- While this app was kept deliberately simple to meet the scope of the school assignment, the structure lays a strong foundation for scaling. 
- The project demonstrated the value of combining backend logic (via SQL) with frontend accessibility (via Streamlit),
  reinforcing how important it is for a data professional to create tools that are both powerful and user-friendly.
